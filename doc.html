    <h2>Processes</h2>
    <p>
      The following are some notes I made early in development that helped me
      make more sense of big abstract concepts like "Combat" and "Dungeon
      Generation" which initially seemed like too big and insurmountable. After
      making these notes, I had a clear plan of action and an easy roadmap to
      follow.

    <h2>How I completed all requirements</h2>
    <div id="RequirementDoc">
      <h3>A. Functional</h3>
      <p>
        The game is completely functional in terms of code related errors. There
        are no Javascript errors that were thrown after a thorough playtest. The
        game is fun and easy to use with 2 control schemes.
      </p>
      <h3>B. Design & Interaction</h3>
      <p>
        The graphic design is reminiscent of an old school computer terminal
        with minimal but aesthetically pleasing design. A prompt comes up on
        load telling the player how to view all available commands, making sure
        they know how to play the game. While the game is not responsive, the
        game fits for most of, if not all 16:9 displays
      </p>
      <h3>C. Media</h3>
      <p>
        There are no images aside from the favicon but there is background music
        as well as attacking and defending sound effects. Aside from that, all
        the text on screen has a font unique to the project.
      </p>
      <h3>D. HTML/CSS</h3>
      <p>
        Both the HTML and the CSS pass validation. The CSS is in an external
        file, along with all the Javascript files, and the HTML is semantically
        structured.
      </p>
      <h3>E. Code Conventions</h3>
      <p>
        ES6 classes are used constantly throughout the entire project with
        things like the entity system, dungeon generation system, and item
        system all using ES6 classes. Code is also separated into multiple
        different files and all functions are all commented with their purpose
        and use.
